# Python-KDE-Project
Kernel Density Estimate of Harassment and Unlicensed Moneylending Crime Statistics in Singapore

This project utilises 10 years worth of publicly available Unlicensed Moneylending Cases and Harassment dataset by Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) obtained from https://data.gov.sg/dataset/unlicensed-moneylending-uml-and-harassment-by-npc

Insights:
1. The Northern region in Singapore continues to make up a significant proportion of Unlicensed Moneylending and Harassment cases every year.
2. There is a growing proportion of crimes reported in the regions surrounding Holland Village, Hougang, and Tampines. 


Note: 
1. Woodlands East and Woodlands West NPC data are na for 2011. I have estimated their respctive crime statistics using the same proportion the NPCs contributed to the total Jurong Police Division statistics reported in 2012.
2. The co-ordinates of NPCs obtained were obtained from https://www.onemap.gov.sg/main/v2/
